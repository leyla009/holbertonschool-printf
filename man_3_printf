.TH _PRINTF 3 "JANUARY 2026" "Holberton School" "Custom Printf Manual"
.SH NAME
_printf \- formatted output conversion
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"
.sp
.BI "int _printf(const char *" format ", ...);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B _printf()
function produces output according to a
.I format
as described below. It mimics the functionality of the standard C library function
.IR printf (3).
.PP
The function writes the output to
.B stdout
(standard output stream). It handles a variety of data types passed as additional arguments based on the conversion specifiers found in the 
.I format 
string.
.SS Conversion Specifiers
A conversion specifier is introduced by the character 
.B %
and ends with a conversion specifier character. The following specifiers are supported:
.TP
.B c
The 
.B int 
argument is converted to an 
.B unsigned char
and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
The 
.B const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to a string. Characters from the string are written up to (but not including) the terminating null byte. If the pointer is 
.B NULL
, the string "(null)" is printed.
.TP
.B %
A literal 
.B % 
is written. No argument is converted.
.TP
.B d, i
The 
.B int 
argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, 
.B _printf() 
returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
.PP
If the format string is 
.B NULL 
or if a trailing 
.B % 
is encountered without a specifier, the function returns \-1.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B _printf("Character:[%c]\\n", 'H');
.br
Output: Character:[H]
.sp
.B _printf("String:[%s]\\n", "I am a string!");
.br
Output: String:[I am a string!]
.sp
.B _printf("Integer:[%d]\\n", 1024);
.br
Output: Integer:[1024]
